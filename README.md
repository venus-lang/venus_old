# The Venus Programming Language

The Venus Programming Language is a C/C++ family language that aims to provide:

- Easy to learn and use: Should be as easy as Python. 
- Meta Programming: CTFE, AST Macros and other compile time structures 
- Memory safety: RAII and RefCount by default, with occasional GC if you want.
- Incremental & Interactive compilation.

# Environment

My goals for the environment include:

- REPL: ipython like repl
- Shell: Integrated shell in the repl. Should be able to completely replace bash/zsh
- Builder: Gradle like builder/package manager
- Editor: vim based commandline ide.
- GUI: a native GUI framework based on OpenGL/SDL
- IDE
