# Venus Tutorial

We'll give you a couple of code examples to walk through language features and serve as a cookbook for common tasks.

Note: Currently NONE of the below features are implemented.

- [Hello, World!](hello-world.md) - Classic Hello World
- [Reading from a file.](read-file.md) - Shows how to do basic file IO
- [Simple HTTP Server.](http-server.md) - Show how easy it is to start a server and serve static html files for everyone.
