# Lanuage Design

The Venus programming language is influenced by the following languages:

### D

You might find Venus much like D because I'm writing this language as my fork of D language. 
D is a great language, it is the most flexible language I've seen so far and writing code in D is a very pleasant experience.
I love many features in D and is going to implement them in Venus as well.

But I'm still trying to create a new language rather than stick to using D because:

- I'd like to learn from creating a new language.
- Some of the default settings in the language was proved not the best. For example: final, pure, nothrow
- D is huge. It has too many features and their interactions make it even more complicated. 
- Unlike Python, D is not a good first language. I'd like a language perfect for newbies as well as proffesionals.

I'm using D to implemented Venus.


### Python

- modules (a mix of python/D)
- stdlib/docs
- ease of use

### Kotlin

Some of the syntax are influenced by kotlin

- val, var
- last function parameter expansion

### C/C++

This is obvious. Just like D, Venus is a C/C++ derivative. Venus will be binary compatible to C, just like D does.

### Rust

### Go
- [Go](https://golang.org/) - Concurrency model, tooling and the strategy of bootstrapping with C and then go full go.

### Clojure
- Clojure - value, ref, state, time... you see the similarities.

### Scala
- Scala - Kotlin is influenced by Scala and I'm too.

### Javascript
